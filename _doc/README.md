## Version History
* Version 1.0 (22-Oct-2022): Finished migrating Media from old site. Cleaned up a few things and it looks and tests ready for a 1.0 release using Jekyll and Liquid!!!
* Version 0.6 (05-Oct-2022): Migrated Reviews and Tech from old site. Need to figure out Markdown image centering on `asides`.
* Version 0.5.1 (14-Aug-2022): Finished migration CV content. One minor annoyance is that Markdown tables (and kramdown) do not support `colspan`.
* Version 0.5 (12-Aug-2022): Added `<article>` and `<aside>` support in layout and Markdown files. Not clean, but the only way to accomplish this I've found using Jekyll. Fixed a lot of CSS issues that were not working well with Jekyll. Added more content to the CV.
* Version 0.4 (27-July-2022): Fixed post layout issues. Cleaned up a few other items.
* Version 0.3 (27-July-2022): Tab images and styling now implemented. Fixed a few CSS issues converting from old to new site.
* Version 0.2 (27-July-2022): Dynamic post page fixes in place and some other minor fixes.
* Version 0.1 (27-July-2022): The first releasable version of the site using Jekyll and based on the current static implementation of vincearter.com.
