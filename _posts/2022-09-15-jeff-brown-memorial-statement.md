# <p style="text-align: center;">Jeff Brown Memorial Statement<br/>15-Sept-2022</p>

Please bear with me a moment. This is a long story that does have a point. There is a reason I'm posting this today. It's been a long night of introspection for me. If you don't have time to read it all, jump to the punch line at the bottom at least. Bottom line up front: **You matter, and you can have a positive impact on other people’s lives, even if you don’t know it.**

_(Note: There are others in my career that had a huge impact on me, yet today I want to talk about one of the first to really care and help bring me along… my good friend Jeff.)_

**Never assume you aren't having an impact on people. You probably are and may not even know it.** Last night around 9:30 PM CT I lost one of my longtime close friends. When I was a young "kid" at my first real programming job back in the early 90s, I was sometimes belittled by other programmers where I worked. These folks had advanced degrees in computer science and similar studies, and I was just a "dumb kid" still working on a degree in psychology and philosophy with some personal experience programming that started when I was an early teen.

Jeff told me to not listen to those people. He told me I was as good as any of them and had raw talent. He took a TON of his own time to turn that simple, raw, and unrefined, talent into actual marketable skills that mattered. He pushed me to be better. He taught me C (a quite complex programming language for a noob like I was back then). He taught me how to deal with project managers and leadership. He taught me to have confidence in myself no matter what others said or judged me on. When the critics started coming to me for advice (and eventually jobs when I moved on) I knew I owed much of that to Jeff's patience and care in teaching me.

Jeff made me laugh. He once lobbed a snowball over my cube wall and into the back of my monitor. This was back when monitors were huge and had a giant tube in them) and it pretty much exploded. It was hilarious (not to the company). Once when I went on vacation, he took all the stuff out of my office and put it in our boss’s office. He printed up a letter that said my desk had been moved. I looked ALL OVER the freaking building for my “new office”. Finally, my boss felt pity on me and told me what was going on. I got my stuff back, but I had to re-build my keyboard as he and another friend had moved all the keys around on the keyboard. Another time, he wanted a bigger cube. As anyone moved or quit around him, he would move the walls. I once went on vacation, and he moved MY walls. Soon our boss was asking, "How did Jeff get a cube that is 3x as big as anyone else's?" Yes. He had to put the walls back. He taught me to up my bowling game at the league level. He was a pro-am player. Multiple sanctioned 300 games. He told me about Ren and Stimpy. (He was a HUGE fan and had a log and powdered toast.) He could crack me up at the most embarrassing times.

He was just that kind of guy. Passionate, giving of himself, and totally hilarious. He could be self-deprecating at times (you can see where I get that from). He was not one to like compliments and believed (as I do) in humility, not arrogance, in one’s own ability. He told me early on that someone will always know more than you. Just get used to it. It’s part of being a programmer. I can guarantee he was one of the top programmers in the area we live in, yet he thought he was just average at best. He was wrong. (One of the few times he was wrong.)

About six months ago we were having dinner together and I told him how much he meant to me and how I would not be where I am today without him. I reminded him of the stories above. I told him that much of my success is because of his impact on me and the time he took to teach a crazy young kid. He blew it off and I told him, "It IS because of you, Jeff." And reiterated that if it weren't for the time, care, and encouragement he gave me, I might have given up and gone back to being a hardware tech and not have pursued software engineering to the level I have for over 30 years. Again, he said it wasn't what he did, and I said it was indeed. I'm glad to have had the chance to tell him that before he died last night.

His loss grieves me more deeply than he could ever know. In the past few years that he was sick we only got to see each other a few times a year over dinner. He was not one for email or social media, so we only really talked when we got together face to face for dinner. We would just joke around all night talking about stupid stuff, old work stuff, and tech. I think our stupid tech and work talk bugged our wives, but I cherish those moments together.

Most of you know that what I love most about my job is helping others. Some of that came from my dad's teaching, yet a lot of it came from what Jeff and others did for me over 30 years ago. I feel driven to pay that back. I have and continue to pay that back. Jeff mattered to me. He still matters to me. I owe him so much.

The point of this long story is to tell you, and convince you, that **YOU CAN HAVE AN IMPACT**. You may not see it now. You may never get to see it yourself. The way you treat and care for others could be **LIFE CHANGING** for them. (For good or ill.) **Let your impact be for good.**

I won't get a chance to go and say goodbye to Jeff in person at the hospital like I planned to do today, so I hope he knew how much he meant to me. Jeff, my friend, you are dear to me. No matter what you would say, you helped drive me to be a better person and to become the man I am today. For that effort, and three decades of friendship, I am eternally grateful. It blesses my heart and soul to know we shall see each other again one day. May God keep you until that time.
