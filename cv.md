Trusted partner, across lines of business with customers and executives, that provided user-centric   strategies that increased the value and adoption of enterprise wide productivity solutions, while remediating technical debt that had caused significant user confusion and lack of adoption in the past.

Partnered closely with vendors and internal global teams to evaluate technologies and planned the direction in which they were implemented and supported by operational teams.
